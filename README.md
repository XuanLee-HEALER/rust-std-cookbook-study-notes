# 《Rust Standard Library Cookbook》 study notes

This project contains my study notes for 《Rust Standard Library Cookbook》. It serves as a record of my process of writing and testing the examples from the book. Since the book was published in 2017, it originally used rustc version 1.30. Consequently, some of the APIs are now outdated, though most remain compatible. (My rustc version when creating this project was 1.88.)
